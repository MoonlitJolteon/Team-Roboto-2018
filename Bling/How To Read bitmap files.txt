For file format see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format#Bitmap_file_header

all bytes are 8 bit

read byte 10 (Finds length of header)
go to the byte of the number above (moves to first byte of image)

first three bytes are the bottom left corner. Then it moves right and then up one line and back to the left

for a single pixel do this
  read first byte as red
  read second byte as blue
  read third byte as green
